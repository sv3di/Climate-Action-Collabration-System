		<h3> The birth of 'global warming' </h3>
		<div class = "c"> </div>
 <p class = "y"> In a report called "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment", the scientists proposed that increasing temperatures in the atmosphere was caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide. But it wasn’t until 1975 that the term “global warming” was coined by geoscientist Wallace Broecker — and it took years before the issue reached mainstream understanding. </p>

			<div class = "c"> </div>
			<p> The organisers wanted to raise awareness of concerns such as pollution and toxic waste and were inspired by the anti-war movement led by students at the time, according to its website. Earth Day has now become a global event ever since 1990, when 200 million people in 141 countries joined forces to bring it to the world stage. </p>

				<h3>Heatwaves</h3>
				<div class = "c"> </div>
<p> By the late 1980s, droughts and record heat led to media coverage around the world, with the LA Times, for example, reporting in 1989 on British scientists' discovery that the previous year had been the hottest ever on record — and crucially, linked this rising heat level to "global warming." 

The story was pertinent in California as the same year the California Energy Comission predicted that the droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires they had experienced were likely to hit the state with more frequency in the years to come. </p>

				<h3>The IPCC</h3>
				<div class = "c"> </div>
			<p>	In 1988, the UN launched its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The expert panel was given the job of assessing the developing science on climate change and providing up-to-date information to governments. Importantly, the IPPC's reports are used as a reference point in international climate negotiations — a key part of the process of getting countries to agree the necessary steps to tacke the issue.

The launch of the IPCC was a big step towards getting countries to attempt to cooperate on how they dealt with the threat of global warming — and decades later in October 2018, it was the IPCC that reported the world only had 12 years left to limit climate catastrophe before its consequences became irreversible. </p>

				<h3> Demonstrations </h3>
				<div class = "c"> </div>
			<p>	Between 2000 and 2019, nine of the hottest years ever recorded took place, but fossil fuel consumption was still rising ever higher. It led to the founding of international pressure groups, such as 350.org — an organisation founded to build a global climate movement.

In 2005, the first Global Day of Action took place during the UN climate talks in Montreal — with people taking part in Canada and around the world, from Bangladesh to Australia. The demonstrations have continued every year.  </p>

				<h3> Student pressure</h3>
				<div class = "c"> </div>
				<p> student groups in the US and later the UK and around the world began pressuring universities to divest from fossil fuels. It was the birth of an effective new focus for campaigners, and students slowly began to see some success.

By 2014, 837 institutions and individual investors had committed to divestment, although only 13 of these were US-based. That same year, the University of Glasgow became the first British university to divest.  

A global movement, fronted by the non-profit network Fossil Free, signed up groups all over the world to pressure companies and institutions to divest, and by the end of 2019 had secured $11 trillion in divestment from fossil fuels. The movement continued to blossom and by the start of 2020, half of the UK’s 154 universities, for example, had committed to divestment from fossil fuels.  </p>
